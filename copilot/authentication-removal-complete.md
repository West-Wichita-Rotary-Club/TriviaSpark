- ✅ Simplified to basic navigation without authentication UI

### 3. Dashboard (dashboard.tsx)
- ✅ Removed user authentication checks and queries
- ✅ Removed logout mutation and functionality

- ✅ Removed authentication-dependent redirect logic

### 4. Main App Routing (App.tsx)

### 5. Events Management (events.tsx)

### 7. File Cleanup
- ✅ Deleted `login.tsx` - no longer needed for anonymous system

- ✅ Deleted `profile.tsx` - no longer needed for anonymous system

### 8. Import Cleanup
- ✅ Removed unused authentication-related imports (`LogOut` icon, etc.)
- ✅ Cleaned up TypeScript references to removed authentication state
- ✅ Updated component dependencies to remove authentication hooks

## Build Verification
- ✅ Application builds successfully with no TypeScript errors
- ✅ All components compile cleanly without authentication dependencies
- ✅ No unused imports or references remaining

## Navigation Flow
**Before:** Home → Login/Register → Dashboard → Events
**After:** Home → Dashboard → Events (fully anonymous)

## Results
The TriviaSpark application is now fully anonymous with:
- No authentication barriers
- No session state management
- Direct access to dashboard from home page
- All user-specific UI elements removed
- Clean, anonymous user experience

The application maintains all core trivia functionality while removing the authentication layer as requested.
