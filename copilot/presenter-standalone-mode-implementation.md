# Presenter Standalone Mode Implementation

## Overview

The presenter mode has been modified to remove the site header and footer to maximize the canvas size for the trivia game, providing a clean, distraction-free experience when presenting trivia to an audience.

## Changes Made

### App.tsx Modification

**File**: `client/src/App.tsx`

**Change**: Modified the presenter route to render without Header and Footer components.

**Before**:

```tsx
{/* Presenter route */}
<Route path="/presenter/:id">
  {(params) => (
    <>
      <Header />
      <PresenterView />
      <Footer />
    </>
  )}
</Route>
```

**After**:

```tsx
{/* Presenter route - standalone mode without header/footer */}
<Route path="/presenter/:id" component={PresenterView} />
```

## Benefits

1. **Maximized Screen Real Estate**: Removing header and footer provides full screen space for trivia content
2. **Distraction-Free Experience**: Clean interface focuses attention on trivia questions and answers
3. **Professional Presentation**: Ideal for presenter mode during events
4. **Consistent with Demo Mode**: Demo routes (`/demo/:id`) already operate without header/footer

## Usage

The presenter mode is now standalone and can be accessed at:

```
https://localhost:14165/presenter/{event-id}
```

For example:

```
https://localhost:14165/presenter/seed-event-coast-to-cascades
```

## Technical Notes

- The `PresenterView` component already contains full-screen styling (`h-screen`)
- The component handles its own navigation and controls
- The change is isolated to routing - no modifications needed to the PresenterView component itself
- The demo routes remain unchanged and continue to work as expected

## Testing

To test the changes:

1. Build the frontend: `npm run build`
2. Start the server: `dotnet run --project ./TriviaSpark.Api/TriviaSpark.Api.csproj`
3. Navigate to: `https://localhost:14165/presenter/seed-event-coast-to-cascades`
4. Verify that no header or footer appears - only the full-screen trivia interface

## Comparison

- **Dashboard/Management Routes**: Still include Header and Footer for navigation
- **Demo Routes** (`/demo/:id`): Already standalone (unchanged)
- **Presenter Routes** (`/presenter/:id`): Now standalone (newly implemented)
- **Join Routes** (`/join/:qrCode`): Remain standalone for participant experience

This implementation provides the optimal presenter experience while maintaining appropriate navigation for administrative functions.
