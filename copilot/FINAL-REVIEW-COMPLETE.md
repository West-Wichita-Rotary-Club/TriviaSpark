# TriviaSpark Documentation Review & Update - COMPLETED

**Date:** August 29, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Reviewer:** GitHub Copilot  

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed a comprehensive review and update of the TriviaSpark application documentation. The primary issue was that existing documentation described an ASP.NET Core/.NET application, but the actual codebase is built with Express.js + TypeScript + React.

## Current Application Status - VERIFIED ✅

**Application is RUNNING and FUNCTIONAL:**

- 🟢 Express.js server running on port 5000
- 🟢 React frontend with hot reload
- 🟢 SQLite database with sample data
- 🟢 WebSocket connections established
- 🟢 Authentication system working (login: mark/mark123)
- 🟢 API endpoints responding correctly
- 🟢 Real-time features operational

**Technology Stack (VERIFIED):**

```
Backend:  Express.js + TypeScript (ESM) + WebSocket + SQLite + Drizzle ORM
Frontend: React 19 + TypeScript 5 + Vite 7 + Tailwind 3 + shadcn/ui
Database: SQLite with Drizzle ORM
Auth:     Session-based with HTTP-only cookies
Deploy:   Node.js hosting or GitHub Pages (static)
```
