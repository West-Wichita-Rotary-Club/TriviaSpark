# EditQuestionForm Difficulty Dropdown Fix

## Issue Description

The difficulty dropdown in the standalone `EditQuestionForm.tsx` component was not being populated correctly when editing existing questions. Even though the question data contained the correct difficulty value, the dropdown would show "Select difficulty" placeholder instead of the actual difficulty value.

## Root Cause

The `EditQuestionForm` component in `/client/src/components/questions/EditQuestionForm.tsx` was missing a `useEffect` hook to synchronize the form state with changes to the `question` prop. This meant that when a question was loaded or switched, the form would retain its initial state instead of updating to reflect the new question's values.

This was the same issue that had been previously fixed in:

- `EditQuestionForm` in `event-manage.tsx`
- `FullQuestionEditor` in `event-trivia-manage.tsx`

But the standalone component had not been updated.

## Solution Implemented

Added a `useEffect` hook to update the form state whenever the `question` prop changes:

```tsx
// Update form state when question prop changes (fixes difficulty dropdown not updating)
useEffect(() => {
  setEditForm({
    question: question.question || "",
    correctAnswer: question.correctAnswer || "",
    options: Array.isArray(question.options) ? [...question.options] : [],
    points: question.points || 100,
    timeLimit: question.timeLimit || 30,
    difficulty: question.difficulty || "medium",
    category: question.category || "",
    explanation: question.explanation || "",
    orderIndex: question.orderIndex || 1,
    backgroundImageUrl: question.backgroundImageUrl || ""
  });
}, [question]);
```

## Files Modified

- `client/src/components/questions/EditQuestionForm.tsx` - Added useEffect to sync form state with prop changes

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Navigate to question edit page**: Visit `/events/{eventId}/manage/trivia/{questionId}`
2. **Verify difficulty display**: The difficulty dropdown should show the correct difficulty value for the question
3. **Test question switching**: If navigating between different questions, verify the dropdown updates correctly
4. **Verify all form fields**: Ensure all other form fields (category, points, time limit, etc.) also update correctly

## Prevention

This bug was part of a pattern where React components don't properly sync local state with changing props. All question editing components should:

1. Use `useEffect` to update local state when props change
2. Include proper dependency arrays in useEffect hooks
3. Test component behavior when props change, not just initial render

## Status

âœ… **COMPLETED** - The difficulty dropdown should now correctly display question difficulty values when editing existing questions in the standalone EditQuestionForm component.
