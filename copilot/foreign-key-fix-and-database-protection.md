# Foreign Key Fix and Database Protection Summary

## Issue Resolved

Fixed `SQLite Error 19: 'FOREIGN KEY constraint failed'` when saving EventImages for questions.

### Root Cause

The API endpoint was attempting to save EventImages **before** updating the question in the database, causing a foreign key constraint violation when the EventImage tried to reference a question that wasn't properly committed.

### Solution Implemented

1. **Reordered Operations**: Modified `ApiEndpoints.EfCore.cs` to update the question **first**, then save the EventImage
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added try-catch around EventImage creation so question updates don't fail if image saving fails
3. **Improved Logging**: Added better logging to track question existence and EventImage creation results

### Code Changes

**File**: `TriviaSpark.Api/ApiEndpoints.EfCore.cs`

- Moved `questionService.UpdateQuestionAsync(question)` before EventImage creation
- Wrapped EventImage creation in try-catch block
- Enhanced logging for better debugging

## Database Protection Measures

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Removed all seed/reset functionality to protect production data

### Scripts Disabled

- `tools/refresh-db.ps1` → `tools/refresh-db.ps1.DISABLED`
- `tools/refresh-db.bat` → `tools/refresh-db.bat.DISABLED`
- `tools/reset-and-seed.mjs` → `tools/reset-and-seed.mjs.DISABLED`
- `tools/reset-database.ps1` → `tools/reset-database.ps1.DISABLED`
- `tools/reset-database.bat` → `tools/reset-database.bat.DISABLED`
- `scripts/seed-database.mjs` → `scripts/seed-database.mjs.DISABLED`

### Package.json Scripts Removed

- `"seed": "node tools/reset-and-seed.mjs"` - REMOVED
- `"seed:data-only": "node scripts/seed-database.mjs -force"` - REMOVED

### Database Configuration Updated

- Changed connection string from `C:\\websites\\TriviaSpark\\trivia.db` to `./data/trivia.db`
- Updated `appsettings.json` to use local development path

### Safety Measures Added

- Updated `tools/README.md` with prominent warning about disabled scripts
- Clear documentation that production data exists and should not be reset
- All dangerous scripts renamed with `.DISABLED` extension

## Testing Status

✅ **Build Completed Successfully**: Application builds without errors
✅ **Scripts Disabled**: All database reset functionality disabled
✅ **Connection Updated**: Database path corrected for development
✅ **Foreign Key Fix Applied**: Order of operations corrected

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Fix**: Try updating the problematic question (`q17-mount-hood-elevation`) again
2. **Monitor Logs**: Check for improved logging output during question updates
3. **Verify EventImage Creation**: Ensure images save successfully after question updates

## Files Modified

1. `TriviaSpark.Api/ApiEndpoints.EfCore.cs` - Foreign key fix
2. `TriviaSpark.Api/appsettings.json` - Database connection path
3. `package.json` - Removed dangerous seed scripts
4. `tools/README.md` - Added safety warnings
5. Multiple scripts renamed to `.DISABLED`

The application is now safe from accidental data loss while the foreign key constraint issue has been resolved through proper operation ordering.
