# Question Dialog Visibility Fix - Complete

## Issue Description

User reported that question dialogs were not visible on the trivia manage page. The dialog would open but the content wasn't properly visible, likely due to recent wine-themed UI changes affecting the background colors and z-index layering.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by:

1. **CSS Custom Properties**: Recent wine-themed updates changed the `--background` and `--card` CSS variables
2. **Z-Index Conflicts**: Dialog overlay and content z-index values may have been competing with other elements
3. **Contrast Issues**: Dialog content background may not have had sufficient contrast against the new wine-themed page backgrounds

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced CSS Dialog Styling

**File**: `client/src/index.css`

Added comprehensive dialog visibility rules:

```css
/* Ensure dialog content is visible with proper contrast and z-index */
[data-radix-popper-content-wrapper] {
  z-index: 1000 !important;
}

/* Dialog overlay should be visible */
[data-radix-dialog-overlay] {
  z-index: 50 !important;
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8) !important;
}

/* Dialog content should be above overlay */
[data-radix-dialog-content] {
  z-index: 51 !important;
}

.dialog-content {
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%) !important;
  border: 2px solid hsl(342, 20%, 88%) !important;
  box-shadow: 0 25px 50px -12px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.25) !important;
  max-height: 90vh !important;
  overflow-y: auto !important;
}
```

**Key Features**:

- **Z-Index Management**: Proper layering with overlay at z-50, content at z-51
- **High Contrast**: Pure white background with wine-themed border
- **Enhanced Shadow**: Strong drop shadow for better definition
- **Responsive Height**: Max height with scrolling for long content

### 2. Component Class Updates

#### Event Management Dialog

**File**: `client/src/pages/event-manage.tsx`

```tsx
<DialogContent className="max-w-3xl dialog-content" data-testid="dialog-edit-question">
```

#### Trivia Management Dialog

**File**: `client/src/pages/event-trivia-manage.tsx`

```tsx
<DialogContent className="max-w-4xl max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto dialog-content">
```

**Benefits**:

- Applied `dialog-content` class for consistent styling
- Maintained responsive sizing
- Preserved overflow handling

## Technical Details

### CSS Specificity Strategy

- Used `!important` declarations to override any conflicting styles
- Targeted Radix UI's data attributes directly for precise control
- Created a reusable `.dialog-content` class for consistency

### Color Scheme Integration

- **Background**: Pure white (`hsl(0, 0%, 100%)`) for maximum readability
- **Border**: Wine-themed (`hsl(342, 20%, 88%)`) to maintain brand consistency
- **Overlay**: Semi-transparent black (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)`) for proper backdrop

### Z-Index Architecture

```
Overlay Layer:    z-index: 50
Content Layer:    z-index: 51
Popper Elements:  z-index: 1000 (for any dropdowns within dialogs)
```

## User Experience Improvements

### After Fix
