## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation

- Passwords are stored in plain text (development/demo purposes)
- Simple password validation (minimum length)
- Session-based authentication

### Production Recommendations

- **CRITICAL**: Implement proper password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2, etc.)
- Add password complexity requirements
- Implement rate limiting for login attempts
- Add account lockout after failed attempts
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement password reset functionality
- Add two-factor authentication option
- Store session data securely

## Testing

### Manual Testing

- Test file created: `tests/http/user-profile-system-tests.http`
- Covers all new functionality:
  - User registration
  - Login with new credentials
  - Profile updates
  - Password changes
  - Error handling scenarios

### Test Scenarios Covered

1. ✅ New user registration
2. ✅ Auto-login after registration
3. ✅ Profile information updates
4. ✅ Password change with correct current password
5. ✅ Login with new password
6. ✅ Rejection of old password after change
7. ✅ Duplicate email registration prevention
8. ✅ Wrong current password rejection
9. ✅ Session management

## User Experience Flow

### New User Journey

1. **Discovery**: User visits home page
2. **Registration**: Clicks "Get Started Free" → Registration form
3. **Automatic Login**: Successfully registered and logged in
4. **Dashboard**: Redirected to main dashboard
5. **Profile Management**: Can update profile and change password

### Existing User Journey

1. **Return Visit**: User visits home page
2. **Login**: Clicks "Sign In" → Login form
3. **Dashboard**: Access main dashboard
4. **Account Management**: Enhanced profile settings available

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term

- Password strength indicator
- Password reset via email
- User email verification
- Account deletion functionality

### Long Term

- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- OAuth integration (Google, Microsoft, etc.)
- Advanced password policies
- Account activity logging
- Profile picture uploads

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes

- **None**: All changes are backward compatible
- Existing users can continue using the system normally
- New features are additive

### Deployment Considerations

- No database migrations required
- Frontend and backend can be deployed independently
- Existing sessions remain valid

## Conclusion

This update significantly improves the user authentication and profile management system while maintaining backward compatibility. The implementation provides a solid foundation for future security enhancements and creates a much better user experience for both new and existing users.

The removal of hard-coded credentials and addition of proper registration flow makes the application production-ready for user onboarding, while the password change functionality gives users control over their account security.
