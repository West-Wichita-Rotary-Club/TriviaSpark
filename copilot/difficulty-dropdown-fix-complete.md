# Difficulty Dropdown Fix - Issue Resolution

## Problem

The difficulty dropdown was not being set correctly when editing questions, even though the database contained proper difficulty values. The dropdown would show empty or default to "medium" regardless of the question's actual difficulty value.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Database Verification

- ✅ Production database at `C:\websites\TriviaSpark\trivia.db` contains questions with proper difficulty values
- ✅ API endpoints correctly return difficulty field in question data
- ✅ Question schema includes difficulty as string type

### Frontend Investigation

The issue was in the React components that handle question editing. Two components had the same problem:

1. **EditQuestionForm** in `event-manage.tsx`
2. **FullQuestionEditor** in `event-trivia-manage.tsx`

Both components initialized their form state with the question data in `useState`, but did not update the state when the question prop changed. This meant that when switching between questions, the form would retain the previous question's values or default values.

## Solution Implemented

### Fixed Components

#### 1. EditQuestionForm (event-manage.tsx)

Added `useEffect` to synchronize form state with question prop changes:

```tsx
// Update form state when question prop changes (fixes difficulty dropdown not updating)
useEffect(() => {
  setEditForm({
    question: question.question || "",
    correctAnswer: question.correctAnswer || "",
    options: Array.isArray(question.options) ? [...question.options] : [],
    points: question.points || 100,
    timeLimit: question.timeLimit || 30,
    difficulty: question.difficulty || "medium",
    category: question.category || "",
    explanation: question.explanation || "",
    orderIndex: question.orderIndex || 1,
    backgroundImageUrl: question.backgroundImageUrl || ""
  });
}, [question]);
```

#### 2. FullQuestionEditor (event-trivia-manage.tsx)

Added similar `useEffect` to update form state:

```tsx
// Update form state when question prop changes (fixes difficulty dropdown not updating)
useEffect(() => {
  setForm({
    question: question.question,
    correctAnswer: question.correctAnswer,
    options: [...(question.options || [])],
    difficulty: question.difficulty || 'medium',
    category: question.category || '',
    points: question.points || 100,
    timeLimit: question.timeLimit || 30,
    orderIndex: question.orderIndex || 1,
    explanation: question.explanation || '',
    backgroundImageUrl: question.backgroundImageUrl || '',
    questionType: inferQuestionType(question)
  });
}, [question]);
```

#### 3. QuestionEdit Component Status

The standalone `question-edit.tsx` component was already working correctly as it uses `react-hook-form` and has proper `useEffect` hooks to update form values when question data changes.

## Additional Fixes

### Database Path Enforcement

Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to make it an explicit hard rule to always use the production database path:

- **CRITICAL DATABASE RULE**: ALWAYS use `C:\websites\TriviaSpark\trivia.db`
- **NEVER** create or use local database files in the repository
- Updated environment variables and development guidelines
- Clarified that `data/` folder is for documentation only, not database files

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test question editing workflow**:
   - Edit a question with difficulty "easy"
   - Switch to edit a question with difficulty "hard"
   - Verify the dropdown shows the correct value for each question

2. **Test all editing interfaces**:
   - Modal editor in event-manage.tsx
   - Full-page editor in event-trivia-manage.tsx
   - Standalone question-edit.tsx page

3. **Verify other form fields**:
   - Ensure all fields (category, points, time limit, etc.) update correctly
   - Test with questions that have null/empty values

## Prevention

This type of bug occurs when React components don't properly sync state with changing props. Best practices:

1. Always use `useEffect` to update local state when props change
2. Consider using `react-hook-form` for complex forms (as done in question-edit.tsx)
3. Add proper dependency arrays to useEffect hooks
4. Test component behavior when props change, not just initial render

## Files Modified

- `client/src/pages/event-manage.tsx` - Added useEffect to sync form state
- `client/src/pages/event-trivia-manage.tsx` - Added useEffect to sync form state
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Enforced production database path usage

## Status

✅ **COMPLETED** - Difficulty dropdown should now correctly display the question's actual difficulty value when editing.
