## üß™ Testing Requirements

### 1. Question Generation Test

**Action**: Navigate to event trivia management page and use AI form
**Expected**: Questions generated and appear in event's question list

### 2. Database Persistence Test  

**Action**: Generate questions and refresh page
**Expected**: Generated questions persist and remain visible

### 3. Error Handling Test

**Action**: Test with invalid inputs or without API key
**Expected**: Graceful error handling with fallback demo questions

### 4. Form Validation Test

**Action**: Submit empty or invalid form data
**Expected**: Proper validation messages displayed

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **User Testing**: Have user test the AI form functionality
2. **Question Management**: Verify generated questions can be edited/deleted
3. **Integration Testing**: Ensure questions work in actual trivia gameplay
4. **Performance Testing**: Test with larger question counts (10+)

## üìù Files Modified

- `client/src/pages/event-trivia-manage.tsx` - Added AI form component
- `TriviaSpark.Api/ApiEndpoints.EfCore.cs` - Enhanced generation endpoint
- `TriviaSpark.Api/appsettings.Development.json` - Fixed empty JSON issue
- User Secrets configuration - Added OpenAI API key

## üîë Key Features

- **AI-Powered**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4o for intelligent question generation
- **Context-Aware**: Incorporates event details for better question relevance  
- **Database Persistent**: Questions saved to SQLite database with proper relationships
- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive form with validation and real-time feedback
- **Secure**: API keys stored in User Secrets, not in repository
- **Fallback Ready**: Demo questions when OpenAI unavailable
- **Extensible**: Form design allows for future enhancements

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria Met
