# GitHub Build Fix Summary

**Issue Date:** August 29, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  

## Problem Description

The GitHub Actions build was failing during the static build process (`npm run build:static`) with the following error:

```
error during build:
[vite:load-fallback] Could not load /home/runner/work/TriviaSpark/TriviaSpark/client/src/data/demoData (imported by client/src/pages/presenter-demo-static.tsx): ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/home/runner/work/TriviaSpark/TriviaSpark/client/src/data/demoData'
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was with the ES module import resolution during the Vite build process. The file `presenter-demo-static.tsx` was importing:

```typescript
import { demoEvent, demoQuestions, demoFunFacts } from "@/data/demoData";
```

However, during the production build, Vite was looking for a file without the proper extension, causing the module resolution to fail.

## Solution Applied

Updated the import statement in `client/src/pages/presenter-demo-static.tsx` to include the explicit `.js` extension:

```typescript
// Before
import { demoEvent, demoQuestions, demoFunFacts } from "@/data/demoData";

// After  
import { demoEvent, demoQuestions, demoFunFacts } from "@/data/demoData.js";
```

## Technical Details

- **File:** `client/src/pages/presenter-demo-static.tsx`
- **Change:** Added `.js` extension to the demoData import
- **Reason:** During production builds, Vite's module resolution requires explicit extensions for proper ES module handling
- **Build Target:** Static build for GitHub Pages deployment

## Verification

1. ✅ Local static build now completes successfully: `npm run build:static`
2. ✅ Generated build artifacts in `/docs` folder
3. ✅ Development server still works correctly: `npm run dev`
4. ✅ All imports resolve properly in both development and production modes

## Build Output Success

The static build now generates:

- Main HTML file: `../docs/index.html` (0.79 kB)
- CSS bundle: `../docs/assets/index-CJQxBdz5.css` (82.09 kB)
- Static demo page: `../docs/assets/presenter-demo-static-D_zNM6Xl.js` (20.49 kB)
- Complete asset bundles for all components

## Additional Context

This issue was related to the ES module specification and how Vite handles module resolution during production builds. The `.js` extension is required for proper ES module imports in production environments, even when importing TypeScript files that are transpiled during the build process.

## Next Steps

The GitHub Pages deployment should now work correctly with this fix. The static build creates a complete standalone version of the TriviaSpark demo that can be served from GitHub Pages without requiring a backend server.
