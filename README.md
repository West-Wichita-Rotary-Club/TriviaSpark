# TriviaSpark

A modern, interactive trivia platform designed for wine dinners, corporate events, fundraisers, and social gatherings. TriviaSpark combines real-time participation, AI-powered content generation, and elegant presentation tools to create engaging trivia experiences.

## 🎯 Platform Overview

TriviaSpark offers two distinct deployment options:

1. **Local Development** - Complete server-side application with SQLite database, real-time features, and full event management
2. **GitHub Pages Demo** - Read-only static site deployment for showcasing platform capabilities

**Current Status**: The platform has recently migrated from Dapper to Entity Framework Core for improved type safety and maintainability. SignalR real-time features are temporarily disabled pending integration with the new EF Core data layer.

### Key Differences

| Feature | Local Development | GitHub Pages |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| Database | ✅ SQLite persistent | ❌ Read-only static |
| Backend Server | ⚠️ ASP.NET Core Web API + EF Core (SignalR disabled) | ❌ Static files only |
| Data Persistence | ✅ Changes saved to .db file | ❌ No data persistence |
| User Authentication | ✅ Sessions & accounts | ❌ No login system |
| AI Generation | ✅ OpenAI integration | ❌ No backend API |
| Real-time Updates | ⚠️ SignalR connection (disabled) | ❌ Static content |
| CRUD Operations | ✅ Create/Edit/Delete | ❌ View-only |

**For development and production use**: Use local setup with SQLite database  
**For demos and showcasing**: Use GitHub Pages static deployment

## 🚀 Live Demo

**GitHub Pages Demo**: [https://west-wichita-rotary-club.github.io/TriviaSpark/](https://west-wichita-rotary-club.github.io/TriviaSpark/)

Experience the TriviaSpark platform with a pre-configured wine country trivia event featuring:

- Interactive presenter interface (read-only)
- 5 engaging trivia questions with explanations
- Fun facts about wine and the Pacific Northwest
- Mobile-responsive design
- No backend server or database

**Note**: This is a static demo. For full functionality including data persistence, user accounts, and real-time features, run the application locally.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Frontend Architecture

- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **Wouter** for lightweight client-side routing
- **TanStack Query** for efficient server state management
- **shadcn/ui** components with Radix UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS** with custom wine-themed design system

### Backend Architecture

- **ASP.NET Core 9 Web API** with C#
- **Entity Framework Core** for database operations with SQLite
- **SignalR** for real-time features (Hub at `/ws`) - *Currently disabled, pending EF Core integration*
- **SQLite** data store via Entity Framework Core
- **OpenAPI/Swagger** at `/swagger` for live API documentation
- **Session-based authentication** with secure cookies
- Optional AI integrations (OpenAI endpoints available where applicable)

### Database

- **SQLite** with local file storage (`./data/trivia.db`) for development/production
- **Entity Framework Core** for type-safe database operations and migrations
- Optional **Turso/LibSQL** for distributed SQLite deployments
- **Local Persistence**: Data saved between restarts when running locally
- **Static Deployment**: No database — read-only content embedded in the application
- Comprehensive schema covering users, events, questions, participants, teams, and analytics
- **Drizzle ORM** used in TypeScript scripts and shared type definitions

---

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ (Node.js 18+ supported)
- npm or yarn
- .NET 9 SDK for ASP.NET Core
- SQLite (embedded - no external database required)
- OpenAI API key (optional, for AI features)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/West-Wichita-Rotary-Club/TriviaSpark.git
   cd TriviaSpark
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment setup**

   ```bash
   # Copy environment template
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Configure your environment variables (SQLite is used by default)
   DATABASE_URL=file:./data/trivia.db
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Database setup (optional)**

   ```bash
   # Entity Framework Core will create the database automatically
   # Optionally seed with sample data using Drizzle scripts
   npm run db:push
   npm run seed
   ```

5. **Start development**

   ```bash
   # Recommended: Build frontend and run the API
   npm run build
   dotnet run --project ./TriviaSpark.Api/TriviaSpark.Api.csproj

   # Alternative: API will auto-build frontend during startup (may be slower)
   dotnet run --project ./TriviaSpark.Api/TriviaSpark.Api.csproj
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Data Persistence

**Local Development**:

- ✅ All data persists in `./data/trivia.db` SQLite file
- ✅ Changes survive server restarts
- ✅ Full CRUD operations available
- ✅ User accounts and sessions maintained

**GitHub Pages Deployment**:

- ❌ No database - static content only  
- ❌ No data persistence between visits
- ❌ Read-only demonstration mode
- ✅ Fast loading and global CDN delivery

---

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### 1. Full Platform Deployment (ASP.NET Core API + SPA)

Recommended for complete functionality with real-time features and persistence.

Common targets:

- Windows (IIS or Windows Service)
- Linux (systemd)
- Docker containers
- Cloud hosts (e.g., Azure App Service, Render)

Key steps:

1) `dotnet publish ./TriviaSpark.Api/TriviaSpark.Api.csproj -c Release`
2) Deploy the publish output folder to your host
3) Ensure `./data/trivia.db` is writable (or configure an alternate path)

### 2. Static Demo Deployment

**Recommended for**: Showcasing platform capabilities, demonstrations

**Platforms**: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel (static), CDN

**Features**:

- No server required
- Embedded demo data
- Full presenter interface
- Mobile responsive

#### GitHub Pages Setup

1. Fork/clone repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Set source to "Deploy from branch: main, folder: /docs"
4. Push changes to trigger automatic deployment

---

## 🧪 Testing & Development

### Development Tools

- **TypeScript** - Full type safety across the frontend and shared scripts
- **Entity Framework Core** - Database migrations and type-safe queries
- **ESLint** - Code quality and consistency
- **Prettier** - Code formatting
- **Drizzle Kit** - Database schema management for scripts and seeding

### Testing Strategy

- Component testing with React Testing Library
- API endpoint testing
- SignalR connection testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

### Development Workflow

1. Run `npm run dev` for frontend-only development with hot-reload
2. Use `/swagger` for API testing and documentation
3. Access development tools via browser DevTools
4. Monitor SignalR connections for real-time feature development (when enabled)

---

## 📈 Performance & Scalability

### Frontend Optimization

- **Lazy Loading** - Components loaded on demand
- **Code Splitting** - Optimized bundle sizes
- **Caching** - Efficient query caching with TanStack Query
- **Image Optimization** - Responsive images and lazy loading

### Backend Performance

- **Connection Pooling** - Efficient database connections
- **Session Management** - Optimized session storage
- **SignalR Scaling** - Real-time connection management
- **API Rate Limiting** - Request throttling and protection

### Scalability Considerations

- Stateless API instances with sticky sessions when required
- Database file I/O considerations for SQLite; consider Turso/LibSQL for distributed needs
- CDN integration for static asset delivery
- Load balancer compatibility for multi-instance deployment
